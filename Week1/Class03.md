> ## What is big o?
>> Big O notation is used to measure algorithm efficiency in terms of time and memory usage. It helps analyze how algorithms perform as the input size increases. 

> What is linked list?
>> Linked lists are a type of data structure where nodes are connected, allowing flexibility in insertion and deletion. Traversing a linked list involves moving from one node to another using references. Adding nodes at the beginning is efficient, but adding at the end requires traversing the entire list.

> When to use linked list?
>> Linked lists are suitable for scenarios where frequent insertion and deletion are required, while arrays are better for quick access and traversal. Understanding these concepts helps determine when to use linked lists.
