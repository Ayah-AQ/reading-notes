## Intro to Hash Tables
> A hashtable is a quick way to store key-value pairs. It uses a special method (hash function) to find where to put and get values, making lookups fast. Collisions happen when different keys point to the same spot. Hashmaps handle this with linked lists. Load factor shows how full the hashmap is. Methods include adding, getting, checking, and collecting keys. Good hashing is key for efficient use.

##  basics of hash tables
>  HashTables, a data structure that uses hash functions to quickly find data. Hashing changes keys into smaller values for easy storage and retrieval. It ensures fast access, usually in one step. To handle cases where multiple keys share the same spot, methods like separate chaining or linear/quadratic probing are used. HashTables are useful for tasks like finding names from roll numbers. They're applied in databases, caches, and more. Monk's example demonstrates this by solving a name-lookup problem using HashTables.

##  what is a hash table?
> The video provides an introduction to the HashTable data structure. HashTables are a type of data organization system used in computer science. They use a hashing function to convert keys into indices, allowing quick data retrieval. The video explains how HashTables work, their advantages, and practical applications in programming. It's part of a series covering HashTables in detail.

## hash table wiki
> A hash table is a data structure that stores and retrieves information using unique codes. It's like a digital storage system where items are organized by codes, but similar codes can cause issues. Hash tables are used in software to quickly find data, manage temporary information, and handle sets of items in programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java.
