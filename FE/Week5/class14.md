# Redux Toolkit (RTK)

> Q1: What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
 >> Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup, reduces boilerplate code, encourages immutable state, handles async actions, and integrates with DevTools.

> Q2: What does configureStore() do?
 >> `configureStore()` sets up a Redux store with default settings, including middleware and DevTools integration.

> Q3: How would I use createSlice()?
 >> `createSlice()` in RTK helps define reducers and action creators concisely. It automates action type creation.

# MobX

> Q1: What is Mobx?
 >> MobX is a JavaScript library for reactive state management, ensuring automatic updates of dependent parts of your app.

> Q2: How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?
 >> MobX ensures state consistency by tracking changes and automatically updating dependent components.

> Q3: How would we build a reactive user interface?
 >> With MobX, define observables for state, computed properties for derived values, and actions for safe state updates in your components to achieve a reactive user interface.
