# React Quick Start


>Q1: What are the building blocks of a React app?
 >>A React app is made of parts called components. Components are like LEGO blocks that build the app's look and behavior.

>Q2: What is the difference between an HTML element and a React component?
 >>An HTML element is a basic part of a webpage. A React component is a reusable part of an app with its own behavior and data.

>Q3: What is JSX and why do we use it?
 >>JSX is like mixed HTML and JavaScript. It's used in React to describe how components look and helps make code readable.

>Q4: Describe the process of embedding JavaScript expressions in JSX.
 >> You can mix JavaScript code in JSX using curly braces {}. For example: `<div>Hello, {name}!</div>`.

>Q5: Does React or JSX have any special features for iteration or conditional logic?
 >>Yes, React has tools for looping with map() and doing if-checks or && for conditional display. JSX makes these easier.

>Q6: How does React know to respond to a userâ€™s inputs?
 >>React listens for user actions like clicks and runs special functions called event handlers. These can change data and update the app.

>Q7: What word indicates that a React component manages data with a Hook?
 >>The word is `useState`. It lets components handle changing data.

>Q8: How can two React components share data?
 >>Components share data by sending it as "props" from parent to child. For more sharing, tools like Redux or Context API can be used.


 # Render and Commit


>Q1: What are the three steps of refreshing a React UI?
 >>1. React plans what the UI should be.
 >>2. It checks what changed since before.
 >>3. React updates only those changes, not everything.

>Q2: How do you trigger updates to a component after the initial render?
 >>Change the data (state or props) of a component. React fixes the UI to match the new data by itself.

>Q3: Does React recreate DOM nodes on every rerender?
 >>No, React is smart. It makes a "picture" of changes and updates only what's needed, not everything.

>Q4: After React has updated the DOM, what still needs to happen before the user sees the change?
 >>The browser makes sure everything looks right, applying styles and arranging things, then it shows the updated stuff on the screen for users to see.
