>Q1: Which Node.js module enables Event Driven Programming?
>>The module is called "events."

>Q2: What is the benefit of combining Object-Oriented Programming with Event Driven Programming?
>>Combining Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Event Driven Programming (EDP) allows us to create applications that are scalable, modular, and maintainable. This combination promotes code reuse and effectively responds to events.

>Q3: How does Event Driven Programming benefit the backend of a web application using Node.js?
>> Imagine a social media platform where a user creates a new post. With event-driven programming in the backend using Node.js, the platform can instantly handle this event by performing actions like storing the post in the database, updating the user's profile, and notifying the user's followers about the new post. Event-driven programming in Node.js enables efficient handling of user interactions, real-time event processing, data updates, and triggering of appropriate actions.
