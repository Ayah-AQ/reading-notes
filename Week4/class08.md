## 5 steps to RBAC

>What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and why do we care?
>>RBAC is a security model based on roles and permissions. It simplifies access control by centralizing permissions and assigning users to roles. This helps control and track user privileges.

>Describe a Role/Permission hierarchy that you might implement using RBAC.
>>In an RBAC hierarchy, there are roles like Superadmin, Administrator, Manager, Team Lead, and User. Each role has different levels of access and responsibilities.


>What approach might you take to implement RBAC?
>> To implement RBAC, you need to identify the systems you want to control access to, create roles based on common access needs, assign users to roles, avoid making individual changes, and periodically review and adjust roles and permissions.

> If Authentication is “you are who you say you are,” what is Authorization?
>> Authorization determines if a user has permission to access resources or perform actions in a system.

> Name three primary rules defined for RBAC.
>> Role Assignment, Role Authorization, and Role Hierarchy.

> Describe RBAC to a non-technical friend.
>> RBAC is a system that assigns permissions to roles instead of individual users. It makes access management simpler and improves security by giving users access based on their roles.

> What Are access rights Associated with? The User? or The Role? Explain.
>> Access rights can be associated with either users or roles. This allows for precise control over who can do what in a system.

> Access Rights, or Authorization, is activated after a >> user successfully does what?
Access rights are activated after successful authentication.

> Explain how RBAC might benefit a business.
>> RBAC simplifies access management, enhances security, ensures compliance, improves productivity, and allows for scalability and flexibility.
