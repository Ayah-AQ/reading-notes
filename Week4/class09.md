>Why:
>>Stacks and queues are important data structures in computer science and programming. They have specific ways of organizing and manipulating data.

>What:
>>A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It's like a stack of objects where the last item added is the first one to be removed. You use "push" to add an element and "pop" to remove the topmost element.

>How:
>>Stack:
Enqueue: To add an element to the queue, you place it at the end of the existing elements.
Dequeue: To remove an element from the queue, you take the element at the front of the queue and remove it, shifting all other elements forward.
