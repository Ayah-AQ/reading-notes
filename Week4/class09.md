>Why:
>>Stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used in computer science and programming. They provide specific ways of organizing and manipulating data based on certain principles.
>What:
>>Stack: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It resembles a stack of objects, where the last item added is the first one to be removed.
(push) used for adding an element to the stack and (pop) for removing the topmost element.
Queue: A queue is also a linear data structure, but it follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The first element inserted into the queue is the first one to be removed. The insertion operation is called (enqueue) and the removal operation is called (dequeue)
>How:
>>Stack:
Push: To add an element to the stack, you place it on top of the existing elements. This new element becomes the top of the stack.
Pop: To remove an element from the stack, you take the topmost element and remove it from the stack. The element below it becomes the new top.
>>Queue:
Enqueue: To add an element to the queue, you place it at the end of the existing elements.
Dequeue: To remove an element from the queue, you take the element at the front of the queue and remove it, shifting all other elements forward.
