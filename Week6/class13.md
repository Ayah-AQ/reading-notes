## WHY
```
Traversal is essential for searching, analyzing data, and performing operations on the tree efficiently.
```
## WHAT 
```
There are two main types of tree traversal: Depth-First Traversal (like exploring each branch entirely) and Breadth-First Traversal (like exploring one level at a time).
```
## HOW
```
1- Depth-First Traversal: Three methods are Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order.
2- Breadth-First Traversal: Visiting nodes level by level.
